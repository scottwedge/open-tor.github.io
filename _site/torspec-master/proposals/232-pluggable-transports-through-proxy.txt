Title: Pluggable Transport through SOCKS proxy
Author: Arturo Filast√≤
Created: 28 February 2012
Status: Finished
Implemented-In: 0.2.6

Overview

  Tor introduced Pluggable Transports in proposal "180 Pluggable
  Transports for circumvention".

  The problem is that Tor currently cannot use a pluggable transport
  proxy and a normal (SOCKS/HTTP) proxy at the same time. This has
  been noticed by users in #5195, where Tor would be failing saying
  "Unacceptable option value: You have configured more than one proxy
  type".

Trivia

  This comes from a discussion that came up with Nick and I promised
  to write a proposal for it if I wanted to hear what he had to say.
  Nick spoke and I am writing this proposal.

Acknowledgments

  Most of the credit goes to Nick Mathewson for the main idea and
  the rest of it goes to George Kadianakis for helping me out in writing
  it.

Motivation

  After looking at some options we decided to go for this solution
  since it guarantees backwards compatibility and is not particularly
  costly to implement.

Design overview

  When Tor is configured to use both a pluggable transport proxy and a
  normal proxy it should delegate the proxying to the pluggable
  transport proxy.

  This can be achieved by specifying the address and port of the normal
  proxy to the pluggable transport proxy using environment variables:
  When both a normal proxy and the ClientTransportPlugin directives
  are set in the torrc, Tor should put the address of the normal proxy
  in an environment variable and start the pluggable transport
  proxy. When the pluggable transport proxy starts, it should read the
  address of the normal proxy and route all its traffic through it.

  After connecting to the normal proxy, the pluggable transport proxy
  notifies Tor whether it managed to connect or not.

  The environment variables also contain the authentication
  credentials for accessing the proxy.

Specifications: Tor Pluggable Transport communication

  When Tor detects a normal proxy directive and a pluggable transport
  proxy directive, it sets the environment variable:

    "TOR_PT_PROXY" -- This is the address of the proxy to be used by
    the pluggable transport proxy. It is in the format:
    <proxy_type>://[<user_name>][:<password>][@]<ip>:<port>
    ex. socks5://tor:test1234@198.51.100.1:8000
        socks4a://198.51.100.2:8001

  Acceptable values for <proxy_type> are: 'socks5', 'socks4a' and 'http'.
  If no <password> can be specified (e.g. in 'socks4a'), it is left out.

  If the pluggable transport proxy detects that the TOR_PT_PROXY
  environment variable is set, it attempts connecting to it. On
  success it writes to stdout: "PROXY DONE".
  On failure it writes: "PROXY-ERROR <errormessage>".

  If Tor does not read a PROXY line or it reads a PROXY-ERROR line
  from its stdout and it is configured to use both a normal proxy and
  a pluggable transport it should kill the transport proxy.
