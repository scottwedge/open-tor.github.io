Title: Making Tor2Web mode faster

1. Introduction

   While chatting with the Tor archons at the winter meeting, two speed
   optimizations for tor2web mode [1] were put forward.  This proposal
   specifies concretizes these two optimizations.  As with the current
   tor2web mode, this quickened tor2web mode negates any client
   anonymity.

2. Tor2web optimizations

2.1. Self-rendezvous

  In the current tor2web mode, the client establishes a 1-hop circuit
  (direct connection) to a chosen rendezvous point.  We propose that,
  alternatively, the client set *itself* as the rendezvous point. This
  coincides with ticket #9685[2].

2.2. direct-introduction

  Identical to the non-tor2web mode, in the current tor2web mode, the
  client establishes a 3-hop circuit to the introduction point.  We
  propose that, alternatively, the client builds a 1-hop circuit to the
  introduction point.
