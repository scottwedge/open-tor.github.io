Title: Adding remittance field to directory specification
Author: Virgil Griffith, Leif Ryge, Rob Jansen

Note: Rejected. People are doing this with ContactInfo lines.

1. Motivation

  We wish to add the ability for individual users to donate to the
  owners of relay operators using a cryptocurrency.  We propose adding
  an optional line to the torrc file which will be published in the
  directory consensus and listed on https://compass.torproject.org.


2. Proposal

  Allow an optional "RemittanceAddresses" line to the torrc file
  containing comma-delimited cryptocurrency URIs.  The format is:

    RemittanceAddressses <currency1>:<address>1,<currency2>:<address2>

  For an example using an actual bitcoin and namecoin address, this is:

    RemittanceAddressses bitcoin:19mP9FKrXqL46Si58pHdhGKow88SUPy1V8,namecoin:NAMEuWT2icj3ef8HWJwetZyZbXaZUJ5hFT

  The contents of a relay's RemittanceAddresses line will be mirrored in
  the relay's router descriptor (which is then published in the
  directory consensus).  This line will be treated akin to the
  ContactInfo field.  A cryptocurrency address may not contain a colon,
  comma, whitespace, or other nonprintable ASCII.

  Like the ContactInfo line, there is no explicit length limit for
  RemittanceAddressses---the only limit is the length of the entire
  descriptor.  If the relay lists multiple addresses of the same
  currency type (e.g., two bitcoin addresses), only the first
  (left-most) one of each currency is published in the directory
  consensus.
