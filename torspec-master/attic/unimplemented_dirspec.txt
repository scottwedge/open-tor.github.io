The following contains portions of the dir-spec that were not implemented in
tor. They're still fine ideas, but do not belong in the specs before they...
well, exist.

Dirport Methods, Section 4.5 (https://trac.torproject.org/9271)

   All the microdescriptors from the current consensus should also be
   available at:
     http://<hostname>/tor/micro/all[.z]
   so a client that's bootstrapping doesn't need to send a 70KB URL just
   to name every microdescriptor it's looking for.
   [Note that /tor/micro/all[.z] is not implemented as of February 21,
   2012. -KL]
